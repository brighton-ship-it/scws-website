                    One of the most common questions we hear is: "How deep will my well need to be?" The answer depends on where you live in San Diego County. Well depth varies dramatically across the region due to differences in geology, elevation, and water table conditions.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mt-12 mb-4">Typical Well Depths by Location</h2>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Ramona & Valley Center (300-600 feet)</h3>
                <p>
                    These valley communities in North County typically see wells between 300-600 feet deep. The decomposed granite and alluvial formations hold productive aquifers at moderate depths. Ramona's water table has remained relatively stable, though depths can vary depending on your specific property location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Properties in San Diego Country Estates or along Highland Valley Road often hit water around 350-450 feet, while some hillside locations may require drilling to 500-600 feet.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Escondido & Poway (250-500 feet)</h3>
                <p>
                    The varied geology of these North County cities creates a range of well depths. Valley floor properties often succeed with 250-350 foot wells, while hillside estates may need 400-500 feet. The volcanic tuff formations common in Poway can create excellent water-bearing zones at various depths.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Alpine & Jamul (400-600 feet)</h3>
                <p>
                    East County backcountry locations typically require deeper wells due to the mountain terrain. Alpine's granite and metamorphic rock formations mean most wells run 400-600 feet, with some properties requiring even deeper drilling. Jamul's sedimentary and volcanic geology creates similar depth requirements.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Julian & Mountain Areas (400-700 feet)</h3>
                <p>
                    Mountain communities at higher elevations require the deepest wells in San Diego County. Julian, at 4,200 feet elevation, typically sees wells drilled 400-700 feet through fractured granite. The high-altitude environment and solid bedrock geology necessitate deep drilling to reach productive water-bearing fractures.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Fallbrook (300-500 feet)</h3>
                <p>
                    The rolling hills of Fallbrook's avocado country typically require 300-500 foot wells. The area's sedimentary formations and proximity to both valley and mountain geology create moderate depth requirements. Agricultural properties often opt for deeper wells to ensure adequate flow rates for irrigation.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mt-12 mb-4">What Affects Well Depth?</h2>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Geology</h3>
                <p>
                    San Diego County's diverse geology is the primary factor determining well depth. Valleys with alluvial deposits generally have shallower water tables. Mountain areas with granite bedrock require drilling deeper to reach fractured zones where water accumulates.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Elevation</h3>
                <p>
                    Higher elevations generally mean deeper wells. As you move from sea level inland toward the mountains, water tables drop. A property at 500 feet elevation will typically need a shallower well than one at 3,000 feet.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Seasonal Variations</h3>
                <p>
                    San Diego's semi-arid climate means water tables fluctuate seasonally. Wells must be drilled deep enough to account for dry years when water tables drop. A well that produces water at 300 feet after winter rains might run dry at that depth during a drought year if not drilled deeper.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Water Demand</h3>
                <p>
                    Properties with high water demands—such as horse facilities, agricultural operations, or large homes—often drill deeper to tap multiple water-bearing zones and ensure adequate flow rates.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mt-12 mb-4">How We Determine Your Well Depth</h2>

                <p>
                    We don't guess at well depth. Our process includes:
