            <p class="text-gray-500 mb-8">Published January 31, 2026 • 6 min read</p>

            <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
                <p class="text-xl mb-6">
                    You turn on the faucet and get a weak trickle instead of a strong flow. Low water pressure from your well is frustrating—and it's one of the most common calls we get from homeowners in San Diego County. The good news? Most causes are fixable.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mt-12 mb-4">Common Causes of Low Well Water Pressure</h2>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">1. Pressure Tank Problems</h3>
                <p>
                    Your pressure tank maintains consistent water pressure throughout your home. When it fails, you'll notice:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
                    <li><strong>Waterlogged tank:</strong> The air bladder has failed, causing the pump to cycle rapidly</li>
                    <li><strong>Incorrect pressure settings:</strong> The tank's pre-charge doesn't match your pressure switch</li>
                    <li><strong>Tank too small:</strong> Undersized tanks can't keep up with demand</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fix:</strong> Check tank pressure with an air gauge. It should be 2 PSI below your cut-in pressure. If the bladder is bad, the tank needs replacement.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">2. Failing Well Pump</h3>
                <p>
                    Well pumps don't last forever. A pump nearing the end of its life will struggle to maintain pressure. Signs include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
                    <li>Pressure drops when multiple fixtures run</li>
                    <li>Pump runs constantly but pressure stays low</li>
                    <li>Sputtering or air in the lines</li>
                    <li>Higher electric bills</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Most submersible pumps last 10-15 years. If yours is older and struggling, it's likely time for a <a href="../pages/services/pump-repair.html" class="text-accent hover:underline">pump replacement</a>.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">3. Clogged Pipes or Screens</h3>
                <p>
                    Sediment, mineral buildup, and debris can restrict water flow:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
                    <li><strong>Well screen:</strong> The screen at the bottom of your well can clog with sand or sediment</li>
                    <li><strong>Pipe scale:</strong> Mineral deposits build up inside pipes over time</li>
                    <li><strong>Filter cartridges:</strong> Whole-house filters need regular replacement</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">4. Dropping Water Table</h3>
                <p>
                    In drought conditions—common here in Southern California—the water table can drop below your pump's intake. This is especially common in areas like:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
                    <li>Julian and the mountain communities</li>
                    <li>Anza and Aguanga</li>
                    <li>Parts of Valley Center</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If your well was drilled during a wet period, the static water level may have dropped. Solutions include lowering the pump or drilling deeper.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-3">5. Pressure Switch Issues</h3>
                <p>
                    The pressure switch tells your pump when to turn on and off. If it's malfunctioning:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
                    <li>Pump may not turn on at the right pressure</li>
                    <li>Contacts can corrode or burn out</li>
                    <li>Settings may need adjustment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A typical residential pressure switch is set to turn on at 30 PSI and off at 50 PSI (30/50 setting). Higher settings like 40/60 are possible if your system supports it.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mt-12 mb-4">How to Diagnose Low Pressure</h2>
                
                <p>Before calling a professional, try these checks:</p>
                
                <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 my-4">
                    <li><strong>Check the pressure gauge:</strong> Your pressure tank has a gauge. Normal is 40-60 PSI. Below 30 PSI indicates a problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen to the pump:</strong> Is it running constantly? Cycling rapidly? Not turning on at all?</li>
                    <li><strong>Check all fixtures:</strong> Is pressure low everywhere, or just one faucet? One fixture points to a localized clog.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check your filters:</strong> When did you last replace whole-house filter cartridges?</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for leaks:</strong> A major leak in your pressure tank or pipes will cause low pressure.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mt-12 mb-4">When to Call a Professional</h2>
                
                <p>Call a well service company if:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
                    <li>Pressure drops suddenly and doesn't recover</li>
                    <li>You see sand or sediment in your water</li>
                    <li>The pump runs but produces no water</li>
                    <li>You hear grinding or unusual noises from the well</li>
                    <li>Your electric bill spikes (pump running constantly)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Low water pressure often indicates a deeper issue. Ignoring it can lead to pump burnout, which is a much more expensive repair than catching problems early.
                </p>
